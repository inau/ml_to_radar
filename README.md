The repository contains the resources used for investigating RADAR simulation and analysing response data using Machine Learning for my masters thesis, 'Applying Machine Learning Techniques to RADAR systems':

Initially i will explore the inner workings of RADAR and investigate how to replicate systems at signal level.
In addition to the above, the production of data in bulk will be investigated as this will be required later.

The next tier of exploration is in digital signal processing(DSP), during which some standard ways of processing RADAR data will be presented.
This knowledge will help during the decision making for the machine learning exploration in section \ref{sec:ml}.

When applying machine learning techniques to predict RADAR data, the main investigation will be whether using a neural network is able to perform just as well as baseline processing functions.

Resources such as the pdf, code, precompiled binaries and different data(subset, as git is not suited for GBs of data) have been made available.
